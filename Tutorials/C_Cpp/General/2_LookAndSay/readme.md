# Problem Statement
Implement a function that outputs the Look and Say sequence:
1
11
21
1211
111221
312211
13112221
1113213211
31131211131221
13211311123113112211

# Building and Running this Examples
1. Create a build folder under root
   `mkdir build`
2. Open a bash shell at the top folder
    `cmake -S . -B build`
3. This is generating a MSVS project for me. You can instead change the generator to minGW (assuming you already donwloaded it)
   `cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" -S . -B build`
   1. You can use the 'clean' option to clear out the cmake files in a project
      `cmake --build build --target clean`
4. cd to the build directory and make
   `cd build; make`
