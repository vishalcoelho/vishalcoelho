# Problem Statement
You are given two integer arrays nums and multipliers of size n and m respectively, where n >= m. The arrays are 1-indexed.

You begin with a score of 0. You want to perform exactly m operations. On the ith operation (1-indexed), you will:

Choose one integer x from either the start or the end of the array nums.
Add multipliers[i] * x to your score.
Remove x from the array nums.
Return the maximum score after performing m operations.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3], multipliers = [3,2,1]
Output: 14
Explanation: An optimal solution is as follows:
- Choose from the end, [1,2,3], adding 3 * 3 = 9 to the score.
- Choose from the end, [1,2], adding 2 * 2 = 4 to the score.
- Choose from the end, [1], adding 1 * 1 = 1 to the score.
The total score is 9 + 4 + 1 = 14.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [-5,-3,-3,-2,7,1], multipliers = [-10,-5,3,4,6]
Output: 102
Explanation: An optimal solution is as follows:
- Choose from the start, [-5,-3,-3,-2,7,1], adding -5 * -10 = 50 to the score.
- Choose from the start, [-3,-3,-2,7,1], adding -3 * -5 = 15 to the score.
- Choose from the start, [-3,-2,7,1], adding -3 * 3 = -9 to the score.
- Choose from the end, [-2,7,1], adding 1 * 4 = 4 to the score.
- Choose from the end, [-2,7], adding 7 * 6 = 42 to the score. 
The total score is 50 + 15 - 9 + 4 + 42 = 102.
 

Constraints:

n == nums.length
m == multipliers.length
1 <= m <= 103
m <= n <= 105
-1000 <= nums[i], multipliers[i] <= 1000

# Building and Running this Examples
1. Create a build folder under root
   `mkdir build`
2. Open a bash shell at the top folder
    `cmake -S . -B build`
3. This is generating a MSVS project for me. You can instead change the generator to minGW (assuming you already donwloaded it)
   `cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" -S . -B build`
   1. You can use the 'clean' option to clear out the cmake files in a project
      `cmake --build build --target clean`
4. cd to the build directory and make
   `cd build; make`
