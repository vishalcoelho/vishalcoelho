# Problem Statement
You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top. Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

Example 1:

Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps
Example 2:

Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step
 

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 45

# Building and Running this Examples
1. Create a build folder under root
   `mkdir build`
2. Open a bash shell at the top folder
    `cmake -S . -B build`
3. This is generating a MSVS project for me. You can instead change the generator to minGW (assuming you already donwloaded it)
   `cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" -S . -B build`
   1. You can use the 'clean' option to clear out the cmake files in a project
      `cmake --build build --target clean`
4. cd to the build directory and make
   `cd build; make`
