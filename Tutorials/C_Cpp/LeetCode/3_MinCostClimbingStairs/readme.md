# Problem Statement
You are given an integer array cost where cost[i] is the cost of ith step on a staircase. Once you pay the cost, you can either climb one or two steps.

You can either start from the step with index 0, or the step with index 1.

Return the minimum cost to reach the top of the floor.

 

Example 1:

Input: cost = [10,15,20]
Output: 15
Explanation: You will start at index 1.
- Pay 15 and climb two steps to reach the top.
The total cost is 15.
Example 2:

Input: cost = [1,100,1,1,1,100,1,1,100,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: You will start at index 0.
- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 2.
- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 4.
- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 6.
- Pay 1 and climb one step to reach index 7.
- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 9.
- Pay 1 and climb one step to reach the top.
The total cost is 6.
 

Constraints:

2 <= cost.length <= 1000
0 <= cost[i] <= 999
 
# Building and Running this Examples
1. Create a build folder under root
   `mkdir build`
2. Open a bash shell at the top folder
    `cmake -S . -B build`
3. This is generating a MSVS project for me. You can instead change the generator to minGW (assuming you already donwloaded it)
   `cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" -S . -B build`
   1. You can use the 'clean' option to clear out the cmake files in a project
      `cmake --build build --target clean`
4. cd to the build directory and make
   `cd build; make`
